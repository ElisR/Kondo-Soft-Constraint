\begin{abstract}
Phase diagram predictions for the Kondo model from mean-field theory are known to disagree with exact results described by a \emph{Bethe ansatz} solution. In this project we apply a new variation of mean-field theory to this problem, which differs in the novel way that it implements positive constraints into the Lagrangian through the introduction of an auxiliary system. This implementation introduces a new free parameter, which has previously been shown to enable a better a prediction of the characteristic energy scale, the Kondo temperature, and other derived properties of the system at zero temperature. Here we show that this free parameter must necessarily be made temperature dependent if it is to reproduce basic features of the finite temperature behaviour, but that after making this allowance it is possible to increase the order of the otherwise second-order phase transition. Nevertheless, it is shown that this added freedom is still not enough to avoid a phase transition entirely, as is typical of other mean-field theories in general.

\section{Introduction}

Metallic systems with localised magnetic impurities have, over the years, been the subject of much research in condensed matter physics, falling under the broader branch of strongly correlated systems which are characterised by interactions being significant in comparison to the kinetic energy dispersion (bandwidth).

The enormous theoretical challenge of studying strongly correlated systems, with their broad ranges of energy scales, means that one often turns to effective models to describe the low energy behaviour, introducing strict constraints that arise after \textit{projecting out} higher energy terms. One such effective model, studied in this project, is the Kondo model. This describes conduction electrons coupled to a (single) localised spin at the origin as a model for the dilute magnetic impurities that are sometimes present in a metal.

The many rich features of the general Kondo problem have been widely studied, with some simpler formulations being amenable to an exact solution via Bethe ansatz techniques. Often times, however, it is necessary to employ approximate methods to obtain results in more general cases, one such method being mean-field theory.

Use of mean-field theory is far from ideal, however, since current formulations applied to the Kondo impurity model are known to give results in disagreement with the Bethe ansatz solution for a characteristic energy of the problem known as the Kondo temperature $ T_{K} $ and (by extension) the magnetic susceptibility at zero temperature. The heat capacity is also greatly underestimated by existing mean-field methods. Recently, a new mean-field approach has been proposed by Garry Goldstein, Claudio Castelnovo (supervising the project) and Claudio Chamon which has given improved estimates of these quantities, which may be a sign that this new variation is indeed an improvement over existing formulations.

One significant aspect of the Kondo model that existing mean-field formulations have thus far failed to capture properly is the crossover from a Kondo to a paramagnetic phase in the temperature-field phase diagram, instead predicting a phase transition as in Figure~\ref{fig:phase_diagram}. The primary aim of this project is therefore to extend this new formulation to finite temperature, specifically to the temperature-field phase diagram and see whether a phase transition or a crossover is predicted. If the predicted behaviour is found to align with that of the exact Bethe ansatz solution, then the case for this new mean-field approach as an alternative to existing formulations would be greatly strengthened.

The report is structured as follows: Section~\ref{sec:theory} introduces the theoretical ideas underpinning the project; Section~\ref{sec:finite_temperature} contains the main finite temperature investigation; Section~\ref{sec:finite_field} gives a brief account of the behaviour at finite magnetic field and Section~\ref{sec:conclusion} concludes with an overview of the main results of the project.

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

This project aimed to explore the finite temperature and field behaviour of the Kondo model as predicted by a promising new variation of mean-field theory: the soft-constraint approach. Failure of conventional mean-field theories to accurately describe the phase diagram of this model makes it an ideal platform to test whether this new method is indeed a significant improvement that could find further use in describing strongly correlated systems.

The vast majority of effort was spent on the extension of this approach to finite-temperature, which was enough to draw some conclusions about the behaviour of the soft-constraint away from the $ (T = 0,~B = 0) $ point in the phase diagram. Crucially, it was found that the associated soft-constraint parameter  has to be allowed to vary with temperature if it is to lead to a solvable set of mean-field equations. This is because the thermal occupancy of the auxiliary fermions introduced is enough to have a significant effect on the \emph{effective} soft-constraint parameter.

Even when allowing the soft-constraint parameter to vary with temperature, a phase transition is found to be inevitable, in disagreement with the crossover obtained from other, more intensive methods. Nevertheless, it was demonstrated that artificially choosing the form of a temperature-dependent soft-constraint parameter can increase the order of the phase transition, though at the cost of zero-temperature accuracy.

The increased difficulty of the mean-field equations in the presence of a magnetic field meant that this aspect of the investigation was limited to a phase boundary calculation. These results suggest that the soft-constraint parameter would have to acquire further field dependencies to better describe the location and nature of the phase transition in the temperature-field plane.
